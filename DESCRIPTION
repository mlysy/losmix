Description: Tools for fitting Gaussian linear mixed-effects models where both the mean and variance terms are random.  Marginal likelihoods are compiled in C++ with automatic differentiation using the 'TMB' library, such that efficient gradient-based optimization algorithms can be readily employed.  The package provides C++ entry points for users to extend the basic model with minimal effort.
